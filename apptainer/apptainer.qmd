# Introduction to Apptainer (i.e. Singularity)

Lesson plan based around materials from [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.github.io/ttt4hpc_containers/basics_running_containers)

## What are containers (and their difference from VMs)?

## Docker vs Apptainer containers: layers, root privileges, relevance for HPC

## Apptainer vs Singularity history and the .sif format

## Structure of an apptainer command: pulling from registry, and running in 3 ways

## Building from a definition file, .def: example with pixi

## Portability to HPC systems, & reproducibilty note: .sif files vs rebuilding from a .def

## Seqera containers resource

## Converting from docker: if anyone uses Docker regularly - maybe they can take this one as an example?
