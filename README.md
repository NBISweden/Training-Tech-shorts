## Background

This repository is intended to be used as a training tool, which
compiles knowledge over time.

Issues are made for a core set of tools to be taught, and what
the scope of those lessons should be. 
Anyone can suggest a lesson and anyone can volunteer to teach it.
Each lesson should be about 30 minutes in length, and is taught through demonstration.

There are 2 lessons of 1h per months, the first one is a demonstration by the teacher on a spceific tool or technology and the second one is a follow-up lesson where anyone can ask questions on what they have tried to implement during the two weeks between the lessons or just show what they have done with the tool/technology. 

The target audience is NBIS and their affiliates, including the managers, as well
as the bioinformaticians. Having the managers there firstly highlights
the importance of the regular training, but also informs them of the
teams capabilities with the core technology stack (some of which may
be useful to the manager too). Regular communication through this
learning track is also meant to foster better collaboration and
provide an environment where people feel comfortable asking questions.

The features provided by Github are useful to enable these actions.
Issues are used to decide lessons. Branches are used to draft
an outline with key points by the teacher. 
Optional : Learners can (if they want their code to be reviewed) make a draft pull request to the lesson branch, where they can set themselves
as assignee, and request reviewers. The code review panel allows
for the learners and teachers to review the content before merging
it back into the branch. Github actions takes care of publishing
the notes into a presentable website for future reference.
This would then be the first lesson to teach.
