ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the NBIS RSE Tools Tech Group!

These blog posts are short lessons on various **Research Software Engineering (RSE) tools** useful in bioinformatics, born from our internal tech groups aiming to foster cross-team collaboration with NBIS and among NBIS affiliates. We aim to share a demonstration of a tool every two weeks.

**Want to discuss or need help?** Start a discussion on our **Discussions page** (https://github.com/NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts/discussions) or reach out on the `#tech-group-rse-tools` channel on NBIS Slack.
