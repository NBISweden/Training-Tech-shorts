## Computations

Quarto lets you perform computations within your notebook. This is typically
done using code blocks denoted by three backticks followed by the language 
you're using in curly brackets.

````{.markdown}
```{{python}}
1 + 1
```
````

Quarto supports computations in several languages:

- [Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html)
- [R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)
- [Julia](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html)
- [Observable](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html)

Additional languages can also be supported through other Jupyter kernels (see Engines below).
See this page for a list of [Jupyter kernels](https://gist.github.com/chronitis/682c4e0d9f663e85e3d87e97cd7d1624).

The languages and packages used in your computations must be available in your `render` environment, and 
are often installed through other means, for example using `conda` or a container platform.

Loaded packages and variables defined within a code block are also accessible from other code blocks, including
inline code blocks. For example, here we create a figure within a div (`:::`) and reference the `x` variable
in both the figure caption and text body.

````{.markdown}
:::{#fig-plot-alt}

```{{r}}
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2

plot(x, y)
```

A plot of $x$ against it's square (n = `{r} length(x)`).
:::

This paragraph refers to @fig-plot-alt for a plot of $y=x^2$ 
based on `{r} length(x)` points.
````

The output of computations can be controlled using [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).
These can be set for the whole document in the yaml front-matter at the top of the document, e.g.,

````{.yml}
---
title: My Experiment
execute:
  echo: false
---
````

Alternatively, execution options can be specified within each code block, e.g.,

````{.markdown}
```{{python}}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
print("""
## Introduction

This is Markdown text.
""")
```
````

Computations can also be used to dynamically generate Markdown
or HTML content by using the `output` format `asis`. For example, 
document sections can be dynamically generated from an input file.
