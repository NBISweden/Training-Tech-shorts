# Introduction to Quarto

### The Quarto CLI (Martin / Tomas)

### Render vs preview

The `quarto render` and `quarto preview` commands are used to generate output from a Quarto (.qmd) document. 

The `quarto render` command generates output in all formats specified in your YAML header (e.g. pdf,html,word), while the `quarto preview` command only generates output in a format suitable for viewing in a web browser.

In a typical workflow, you would use the `quarto preview` command to view the output of your document as you are working on it.

```bash
quarto preview my.qmd
```
This command will start a local web server and open a web browser to view the output of the document. The web server will automatically update the output as you make changes to the document.

Once you are ready to produce your final output you can use the `quarto render` command.

```bash
quarto render my.qmd
```
