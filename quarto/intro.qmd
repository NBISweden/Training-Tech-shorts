# Introduction to Quarto

## What is Quarto (Tomas / André)

### The Quarto CLI (Martin / Tomas)

## Authoring (Estelle / Martin)

### Render vs preview

The `quarto render` and `quarto preview` commands are used to generate output from a Quarto (.qmd) document. 

The `quarto render` command generates output in all formats specified in your YAML header (e.g. pdf,html,word) or in your command line with the option --to, while the `quarto preview` command only generates output in a format suitable for viewing in a web browser.

In a typical workflow, you would use the `quarto preview` command to view the output of your document as you are working on it.

```bash
quarto preview my.qmd
```
This command will start a local web server and open a web browser to view the output of the document. The web server will automatically update the output as you make changes to the document.

Once you are ready to produce your final output you can use the `quarto render` command.

```bash
quarto render my.qmd
```

## Computations

Quarto lets you perform computations within your notebook. This is typically
done using code blocks denoted by three backticks followed by the language 
you're using in curly brackets.

````{.markdown}
```{{python}}
1 + 1
```
````

Quarto supports computations in several languages:

- [Python](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html)
- [R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)
- [Julia](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html)
- [Observable](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html)

Additional languages can also be supported through other Jupyter kernels (see Engines below).
See this page for a list of [Jupyter kernels](https://gist.github.com/chronitis/682c4e0d9f663e85e3d87e97cd7d1624).

The languages and packages used in your computations must be available in your `render` environment, and 
are often installed through other means, for example using `conda` or a container platform.

Packages and variables created within one code block are also accessible from other code blocks, including
inline code blocks. For example, here we create a figure and reference the value in the caption.

````{.markdown}
:::{#fig-plot-alt}

```{{r}}
x <- 1:10
y <- x^2

plot(x, y)
```

A plot of $x$ against it's square (n = `{r} length(x)`).

The output of computations can be controlled using [execution options](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).
These can be set for the whole document in the yaml front-matter at the top of the document, e.g.,

````{.yml}
---
title: My Experiment
execute:
  echo: false
---
````

Alternatively, execution options can be specified within each code block, e.g.,

````{.markdown}
```{{python}}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
print("""

""")
```
````

Computations can also be used to dynamically generate Markdown
or HTML content by using the `output` format `asis`. For example, 
document sections can be dynamically generated from an input file.
