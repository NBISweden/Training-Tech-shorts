If you want future builds of the container to be identical, try to find a static tag, e.g. a github commit tag\nIn addition, using commands from package managers like apt-get update in the .def will make the container less reproducible, as the package versions will change over time\nBy default Apptainer/Singularity loads certain directories such as $HOME (see below), and this means local packages (e.g. Python, R, etc.) can be picked up and loaded instead of the ones in the container. To prevent this, do something like this."

    "text": "File staging and git commit\nStaging in Git involves adding new, modified, or deleted files to a staging area before committing them. This allows for flexibility in choosing the files to commit.\n\nCheck status via git status You’ll see what branch you are on and status of files (untracked, modified, or deleted).\n\nStage Files to Prepare for Commit\n\n\nStage all files: git add .\nStage a file: git add example.html\nStage a folder: git add myfolder\n\n\nCheck status again: git status You should see there are changes ready to be committed.\nUnstage a File\n\n\nIf you accidental stage something, use the following command to unstage it: git reset HEAD example.html\n\n\nDeleting Files\n\n\nIf you delete files they will appear in git status as deleted, and you must use git add to stage them. Another way to do this is using git rm command, which both deletes a file and stages it all with one command:\ngit rm example.html to remove a file (and stage it)\ngit rm -r myfolder to remove a folder (and stage it)\n\n\nCommit Files\n\n\ngit commit -m \"Message that describes what this change does\"\n\n\nCheck status again: git status If all changes have been committed, and there are no untracked files, it should say: nothing to commit, working tree clean.\nView a List of Commits\n\n\nWhen viewing a list of commits, there are various commands depending on how much info you want to see.\nTo see a simplified list of commits, run this command: git log --oneline\nTo see a list of commits with more detail (such who made the commit and when), run this command: git log NOTE: If the list is long, use the Down/Up Arrow keys to scroll and hit Q to quit.\nTo see a list of commits with even more detail (including which files changed), run this command: git log --stat\n\n\nFixing Your Last Commit Message\n\n\ngit commit --amend -m \"Put your corrected message here\": to correct a mistake in your last commit message\n\n\nChanging committed files\n\n\nThe --no-edit flag will allow you to make the amendment to your commit without changing its commit message. Example:\n\n# Edit hello.py and main.py\ngit add hello.py\ngit commit \n# Realize you forgot to add the changes from main.py \ngit add main.py \ngit commit --amend --no-edit\nThe resulting commit will replace the incomplete one, and it will look like we committed the changes to hello.py and main.py in a single snapshot."

The two rightmost drop-down lists refer to the pull request source and should point to your repository and, importantly, the branch that you are editing (and make sure it matches the target branch!).

See this page for a list of Jupyter kernels.\nThe languages and packages used in your computations must be available in your render environment, and are often installed through other means, for example using conda or a container platform.\nLoaded packages and variables defined within a code block are also accessible from other code blocks, including inline code blocks. For example, here we create a figure within a div (:::) and reference the x variable in both the figure caption and text body.\n:::{#fig-plot-alt}\n\n```{r}\nx &lt;- 1:10\ny &lt;- x^2\n\nplot(x, y)\n```\n\nA plot of $x$ against it's square (n = `{r} length(x)`).\n:::\n\nThis paragraph refers to @fig-plot-alt for a plot of $y=x^2$ \nbased on `{r} length(x)` points.\nThe output of computations can be controlled using execution options. These can be set for the whole document in the yaml front-matter at the top of the document, e.g.,\n---\ntitle: My Experiment\nexecute:\n  echo: false\n---\nAlternatively, execution options can be specified within each code block, e.g.,\n```{python}\n#| echo: false\n#| output: asis\nprint(\"\"\"\n## Introduction\n\nThis is Markdown text.\n\"\"\")\n```\nComputations can also be used to dynamically generate Markdown or HTML content by using the output format asis. For example, document sections can be dynamically generated from an input file."

    "text": "Pixi is a package management tool that can serve as a replacement for Conda or Mamba. It is designed to be faster, multithreaded, and flexible. Like Conda, Pixi environments are not isolated, which allows you to interact with third-party tools that are available in your system’s PATH, for example, job submission managers like slurm, or container platforms.\n\n\nPixi is somehwat compatible with Conda. You can:\n\nInstall packages using the same Conda channels (e.g., conda-forge, bioconda).\nInitialise project environments using existing Conda environment files.\n\nHowever, you cannot activate a conda environment using Pixi, or vice-versa.\n\n\n\nIn Pixi, the environment configuration file (.pixi.toml) lives in the project directory. This ensures that the environment is tied to the project and simplifies reproducibility. When an environment is first created, a pixi.lock file is also written. This should also be commited to the git repository, just like the toml file. This records every package used to make the environment for each platform that should be supported. This differs from Conda, in which lock files must be explicitly generated with a separate command."

    "text": "Pixi is a package management tool that can serve as a replacement for Conda or Mamba. It is designed to be faster, multithreaded, and flexible. Like Conda, Pixi environments are not isolated, which allows you to interact with third-party tools that are available in your system’s PATH, for example, job submission managers like slurm, or container platforms.\n\n\nPixi is somehwat compatible with Conda. You can:\n\nInstall packages using the same Conda channels (e.g., conda-forge, bioconda).\nInitialise project environments using existing Conda environment files.\n\nHowever, you cannot activate a conda environment using Pixi, or vice-versa.\n\n\n\nIn Pixi, the environment configuration file (.pixi.toml) lives in the project directory. This ensures that the environment is tied to the project and simplifies reproducibility. When an environment is first created, a pixi.lock file is also written. This should also be commited to the git repository, just like the toml file. This records every package used to make the environment for each platform that should be supported. This differs from Conda, in which lock files must be explicitly generated with a separate command."

This folder contains the libraries and binaries needed for the environment. If needed, you can safely delete this folder, and it will be recreated from the pixi.lock file in your project, the next time you use the environment.\nThe command\npixi clean\ndeletes the pixi environment binaries, and the command\npixi clean cache\ndeletes the package archives that were downloaded and unpacked to create the environment.\n\n\nEnvironment features\nUnlike Conda, in which you can define multiple global environments, Pixi handles multi-environment projects in a different way. Packages are installed into Features, which in turn define an Environment. Features are isolated from each other, helping to avoid version clashes between tools. See Pixi docs - Multi Environment for more on defining multiple environments in a TOML."
