# Gitpod

## What is Gitpod

Gitpod is a developer environment that runs in your browser. In order to use it, you need a Git repository (either on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). Gitpod opens up a container on your Git repository. This container is built from the file ".gitpod.yml" present in the repository.   

There are different pricing depending on your needs such as:  

- Free plan (50 hours per month)

- Pas-as-you-go  

- Company plan (custom)

NBIS does not have a Gitpod account. Mahesh has an open source plan (nammed NBIS).


## How to login to Gitpod

- Go to the [Gitpod site](https://gitpod.io)

- Select your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub), and authenticate

- If successful you should land on the workspaces page, with organisation settings at top left, and personal settings at top right

- Now when you start a Gitpod environment you'll be connected to your version control system

## How to start a Gitpod 

To start a workspace, follow these steps:

- Navigate to your repository on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. 
- Add `gitpod.io/#` before the URL address of your repository. This will create a new URL address that directs you to the Gitpod workspace setup page. On that page, you can make the following choices:
    1. The source repository for which the gitpod workspace will be created.
    2. The code editor. 
    3. The computing resources required for the workspace. 
- After making your choices, the code editor will open, allowing the user can start working on the files in the repository. The user's working directory is a cloned folder of the Github repository located on the Gitpod server, not lcoally on the computer. 
- Any changes to the files within that folder can be pushed to the repository using Git commands. 

**Note**: If you are editing a public Github public repository, Gitpod requires the "public_repo" permission to push changes. To do it, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to gitpod.io.
2. Click on your user icon
3. Click "user settings"
4. Navigate to "Git Providers"
5. Click the actions icon on the GitHub provider
6. Click "edit permissions"
7. Check "public_repo"
8. Click "Update permissions"
9. You will be redirected to Github for authentication.

After granting permissions, the user can push changes to the repository. 

## How to configure Gitpod

- A gitpod workspace is configured mainly through the `.gitpod.yml` file at the root of your repository (e.g. github.com/user/repo/.gitpod.yml). 

- This file is read by Gitpod when the workspace is started, and can be used to specify the base workspace image, and a list of tasks that will be run when the workspace is started.

- Below is the yml file we use in the Training-tech-shorts repo.

```yml
image: nfcore/gitpod:latest

tasks:
  - name: Update Nextflow
    command: nextflow self-update
  - name: Install Pixi
    command: |
      sudo chown gitpod -R /home/gitpod/
      curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
      . /home/gitpod/.bash_profile
  - name: Install Quarto
    command: |
      wget https://quarto.org/download/latest/quarto-linux-amd64.deb
      # sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev
      sudo dpkg -i quarto-linux-amd64.deb
      rm quarto-linux-amd64.deb
      quarto check all
```
- The `image:` section of the `.gitpod.yml` is used to specify the base workspace image, this can be a public or private docker image, or a Dockerfile (in this case the base image must be public).

```yml
# public image
image: nfcore/gitpod:latest

# local Dockerfile
image:
    file: .gitpod.Dockerfile
```

- The `tasks:` section of the `.gitpod.yml` is used to specify a list of tasks that will be run when the workspace is started. Each task should have a `name:` and a `command:` section. The `command:` section specifies one or more shell commands that will be run in the workspace.

```yml
tasks:
  - name: Update Nextflow
    command: nextflow self-update
```

- In order to execute multiple commands in a single task, you can use the `|` operator to specify a block of shell commands, each in one line.

```yml
tasks:
  - name: Install Pixi
    command: |
      sudo chown gitpod -R /home/gitpod/
      curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
      . /home/gitpod/.bash_profile
```

- Optionally, you can also add a `ports:` section to the `.gitpod.yml` file to specify a list of ports that should be opened by the workspace. This can be useful when hosting a web server or anything that needs to be accessed from outside the workspace.

```yml
ports:
  - port: 8080
    onOpen: open-preview
```

## Uses for Gitpod (Jason / Estelle to review)

- Demonstration: The containerized nature of gitpod makes it useful for serving instances of a program in a standardized environment for demonstration.

- Development: There are many software development tools available in the standard docker container. Pull requests can be managed from within gitpod and explored safely within a container.

- Experimentation: The ephemeral nature of the environment, and its standardizeed tools make gitpod excellent for testing code and sandbox experimentation.

- Training: A pre-built environment can be provided which can be very useful if, for example, Rackham is down during a course.
