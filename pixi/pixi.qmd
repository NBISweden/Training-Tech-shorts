## Intro to Pixi

This section is a brief summary of the concepts discussed in the meeting. 

## Why Pixi?

Pixi is a package management tool that serves as a replacement for Conda or Mamba. It is designed to be faster, multithreaded, and flexible. Like Conda, Pixi environments are not isolated, which allows you to interact with third-party tools that are available in your system's PATH.

### Compatibility

Pixi is somehwat compatible with Conda. You can:

- Use the same Conda channels (e.g., `conda-forge`, `bioconda`).
- Use existing Conda environment files with Pixi.

However, you cannot activate a conda environment using Pixi, or vice-versa. 

### Key Difference

In Pixi, the environment configuration file (`.pixi.toml`) lives in the project directory. This ensures that the environment is tied to the project and simplifies reproducibility.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install Pixi and add it to your shell's configuration (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).

```{.bash}
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

2. Initialize a Pixi environment in your project:

```{.bash}
pixi init -c conda-forge -c bioconda -p linux-64 -p osx-arm64
```

Here:
- `-c` specifies the channels to use (e.g., `conda-forge`, `bioconda`)
- `-p` sets the platforms 

By default, Pixi will set the environment for your platform (e.g., `linux-64`), but you can specify additional platforms as needed. 

The `pixi init`command will create a `pixi.toml`file, as well as a `pixi.lock`file. Both should be committed into the git repository. The Pixi environments are tied to these two files and thus the project directory.

### Adding Packages

You can add packages to your environment using the `pixi add` command:

```{.bash}
pixi add bwa samtools
```

You can add Python packages from PyPI using Pixi:

```{.bash}
pixi add python
pixi add --pypi multiqc
```

Alternatively, you can directly modify the `.pixi.toml` file in your project directory.

## Managing Environments

### Files in the Directory

When you use Pixi, it creates a `.pixi` folder in your project directory. This folder contains cached files and other data. If needed, you can safely delete this folder or configure the cache to use a scratch directory.

To clean the cache:

```{.bash}
pixi clean cache
```

### Reproducibility

Pixi uses two key files for environment management:

- `.pixi.toml`: Specifies the environment configuration.
- `.pixi.lock`: Locks down the specific package versions for reproducibility.

You should commit both files to your version control system to share the exact environment setup with collaborators.

---

## Tasks in Pixi

Pixi allows you to define and run tasks directly in the `.pixi.toml` file. For example:

```toml
[tasks]
name-of-task = "nextflow run main.nf -profile PDC"
```

One can also add tasks via the command line: 

```{.bash}
pixi task add hello python hello_world.py
```

### Task Features

- Tasks can be combined or run conditionally using `depends-on`.
- You can chain tasks for complex workflows.

---

## Working with the Shell

Pixi provides a shell environment based on the Deno shell. Many basic Bash commands still work, allowing for:

- Chaining tools.
- Command substitution.

### Activating the Environment

To activate the environment:

```{.bash}
pixi shell
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Features

PIXI allows multiple "features" in a single project. Features are isolated from each other, helping to avoid version clashes between tools.

### Intel emulation on ARM Macs

Although packages are increasingly being built for ARM architecture CPUS, not all tools are built for `osx-arm64`. However, they may have been built for `osx-64` (i.e., intel architecture CPUS), in addition to `linux-64`. MacOS includes the tool Rosetta, which can be used to emulate intel on arm Macs, at the cost of performance. 

By supporting only `linux-64` and `osx-64` as platforms, Pixi will automatically run the tools using Rosetta emulation on Mac ARM computers. 

```bash
pixi init \
  --channel "conda-forge" \
  --channel "bioconda" \
  --platform "linux-64" \
  --platform "osx-64"
```

## Additional Commands

### Updating Pixi

To update Pixi:

```{.bash}
pixi self-update
```

To clean the cache: 

```{.bash}
pixi clean cache
```
