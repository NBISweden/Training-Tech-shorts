## How It Works

Walkthroughs are short (~30 minutes) demonstrations, taught by volunteers from within the Tech group.
The sessions are then written up and shared here for future reference as blog posts.

### Target Audience

Our primary audience is **NBIS staff and affiliates**, both **bioinformaticians and managers**.

* **For Learners:** Provides regular, practical training on our core technology stack.
* **For Managers:** Highlights the importance of regular training and informs them of the teams' collective capabilities.

### Contributing & Suggesting Walkthroughs

We use **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts/issues)** to manage the walkthrough pipeline:

1. **Suggest a Topic:** Create a new Issue to propose a tool or topic you'd like to see covered.
2. **Vote on Topics:** Use the reactions feature üëç to upvote topics you're interested in.
3. **Volunteer to Teach:** Anyone can volunteer to prepare and demonstrate a walkthrough. You don't need to be an expert - just be willing to learn and share!
4. **Write it Up:** After the demo, the walkthrough should be written up as a blog post, which will be reviewed and published here. Anyone can contribute to the write-up.
