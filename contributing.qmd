## How It Works

Lessons are short (~30 minutes) demonstrations, taught by volunteers from within the Tech group.

### Target Audience

Our primary audience is **NBIS staff and affiliates**, both **bioinformaticians and managers**.

* **For Learners:** Provides regular, practical training on our core technology stack.
* **For Managers:** Highlights the importance of regular training and informs them of the teams' collective capabilities.
