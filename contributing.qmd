# Contributing

## Quick start

The first step is to read over the lesson Github Collaboration.

### Summary

1. Make a branch for your lesson.
2. Create a Quarto markdown document with `## Objectives` and `## Key points` and add it to that branch.
3. Add the document to the `_quarto.yml`.
4. Teach your topic to your team for 30-45 mins. Please remember to record the lesson.
5. Each learner selects a key point to contribute material on. Use the lesson issue for that topic to assign
yourself and another learner to review your contribution.
6. Make a draft pull request to the lesson branch and ask the other learner assigned to review. Make changes until you're both happy.
7. Mark the pull request as ready, and request the instructor to review.
8. When the instructor is happy with the changes they should merge the learners
contribution back into their lesson branch.
9. The instructor reviews and merges the lesson branch when all contributions
have been received. It is the responsibility of the teacher to make sure
contributions have been received after two weeks.

### Review lessons

Each lesson should be followed up by a review lesson the following week.
Here, the teacher should review and discuss points that they notice
learners had difficulty with.
