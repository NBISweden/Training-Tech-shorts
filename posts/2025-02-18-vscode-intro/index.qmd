## Background

- VSCode is owned by Microsoft, who also own GitHub and Copilot
- What this means for users: regularly updated, and tight integration of GitHub/Copilot features, large community
- Open Source

## Opening VSCode in WSL2

- If VSCode is installed in Windows, typing `code` in the terminal launches a new window in WSL2

## Basic help for new users

- Help -> editor playground
- Help -> keyboard shortcuts reference

## Basic tips

- Use settings sync to easily transfer configurations between machines (N.B. GitPod uses a different settings sync server, so VSCode instances on GitPod need to be configured separately, but only once if you turn on sync there also)
- Use user profiles to switch between different configurations
- Set editors to auto-save
- Customise and use keybindings (see the cheatsheet for the commonly used defaults)
- Settings can be changed either via default/user json files or the preferences interface
- Use the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows), `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) 
- Explore extensions for additional functionality, e.g.:
	- Language support
	- GitHub Copilot & Chat
	- Remote SSH
	- Todo highlight
	- Rainbow CSV

## Remote development (VSCode environment on a remote server) 

- Get the extension: `Remote - SSH`
- Configure the `~/.ssh` config file on your local machine, e.g.:

```
Host dardel
        Hostname dardel.pdc.kth.se
        User myname
        IdentityFile /home/myname/.ssh/id-ed25519-dardel
```

- If using Mac/Linux installation of VSCode, that's all for setup

- If using WSL2 within Windows, you also need to copy the contents of the `~/.ssh` folder (config file and public + private keys) over to `C:\Users\myname\.ssh`. You additionally must update the Windows `config` file IdentityFile paths to point to the respective keys, e.g.: `IdentityFile C:\Users\myname\.ssh\id-ed25519-dardel`. Permissions on this folder are usually automatic, but if necessary ensure the folder and contents are readable (right click -> show more... -> properties -> security)

- Back in VSCode, open the command palette, type `ssh`, and select `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...`

- The hostnames you configured should now appear and you can connect

## Copilot

- Get the Copilot extensions (`GitHub Copilot` & `GitHub Copilot Chat`)
- Link up your GitHub account - ensure you have signed up for the GitHub education program that offers free copilot (https://github.com/education)
- Main features are:
	- Inline suggestions
	- Inline prompt
	- Copilot Chat -> similar to ChatGPT interface and use cases
	- Copilot Edit -> large scale direct code editing with AI
