Nextflow is a workflow manager rapidly gaining popularity in the Bioinformatics community, and is highly
recommended for reproducible research. But do you really need to learn it? When should it
be used and when not? Let's take a look at scenarios where Nextflow shines and where other tools might be
a better fit.

## Where Nextflow shines:

### Scalability:

When a pipeline is written to process a few samples, it means it's generally written in a robust enough
way that it can process several more without changes to the workflow. Nextflow handles
distribution of these tasks, enabling seamless scaling from a handful of samples to hundreds or
even thousands without major code changes. This especially important for large-scale genomics projects
or growing datasets. Imagine you've developed a variant calling pipeline for 10 samples;
with Nextflow, running it on 1000 samples becomes a matter of potentially adjusting configuration rather than rewriting
the core logic. Importantly, it allows rapid development on a few scaled-down samples, and easy application
to a much larger data set.

### Portability:

Nextflow workflows can run on multiple compute environments - from your local machine to High-Performance
Computing (HPC) clusters or Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure - thanks to its abstraction layer.
Nextflow isolates the workflow definition from the underlying infrastructure. This means you can develop and
test your pipeline on a smaller scale and then deploy it to a more powerful environment without worrying about
environment-specific commands or resource management details. This portability fosters collaboration and ensures
your research is not tied to a specific computing infrastructure.

### Parallelization:

Nextflow efficiently distributes tasks across available compute resources. It automatically schedules
and executes processes, maximizing resource utilisation and reducing runtime. Instead of manually
managing parallel execution with complex scripts, Nextflow simplifies this process, letting
you focus on the scientific logic of your pipeline. This parallelization is a major advantage
for computationally intensive bioinformatics workflows.

### Heterogeneous tool environments:

With Nextflow, you can define containerized environments (e.g., using Docker or Singularity) for each process
within your workflow, elegantly resolving software dependency conflicts. For instance, one step
might require a specific version of Python libraries while another needs a particular version of a bioinformatics tool.
By containerizing each process, Nextflow ensures that each tool runs in its isolated and correctly configured environment,
leading to more reliable and reproducible results.

### Feature rich Domain Specific Language:

Built on top of the Groovy programming language, Nextflow provides a powerful and expressive Domain Specific Language (DSL).
This DSL allows you to model complex data flows intuitively, define dependencies between processes, and handle various data
structures with ease. Furthermore, Nextflow's extensibility through external Groovy libraries allows you to incorporate
advanced functionalities and tailor the language to your specific needs. This rich DSL makes defining sophisticated bioinformatics pipelines more manageable and less error-prone compared to traditional scripting approaches.

### Scripting Language flexibility:

Nextflow doesn't restrict you to a single scripting language. It seamlessly supports Shell scripts, R, Python, Perl, or any
other language that your compute environment can execute. This flexibility allows you to leverage your existing expertise
and integrate tools written in different languages into a single cohesive workflow. You can use the best tool for each
specific task without being constrained by the workflow manager's limitations.

### Rapid prototyping:

Nextflow supports reentrancy, allowing workflows to resume from where they failed or were
interrupted. Combined with its simple task description language, this feature speeds up pipeline
prototyping and debugging.

### Community support:

Nextflow has a large user base, and in particular has the [`nf-core` community](https://nf-co.re/) based around building
scalable pipelines written in Nextflow for public use. There are several forums where one can get help with implementing
Nextflow and debugging issues. This allows developers to spend less time struggling with issues.

- [Seqera Community Forum](https://community.seqera.io/)
- [Nextflow Slack](https://www.nextflow.io/slack-invite.html)
- [Nextflow Discussions](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/discussions)
- [nf-core Slack](https://nf-co.re/join)

It's unclear whether other tools have similar communities, and the primary method of support appears to be through their
Github issues and discussions, or Stack Overflow.

Community developed existing pipelines also save time by eliminating the need to reimplement solutions.

## Where Nextflow is not optimal:

While Nextflow is powerful, there are scenarios where it may not be the best choice.

### Interactive exploratory analyses:

For initial data exploration and interactive analyses, tools like [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebooks or RStudio might offer a more
immediate and flexible environment. These tools excel at providing a rapid feedback loop for trying out different approaches,
visualizing data, and generating preliminary insights. Nextflow, with its focus on structured and automated workflows, might
introduce unnecessary overhead for purely exploratory tasks.

### Environment overhead:

For smaller, self-contained workflows primarily using a single language like R (where packages like `targets` together with
`renv` provide excellent workflow management) or Python (where Snakemake can be a lighter alternative), the full power and
complexity of Nextflow might be overkill. If your analysis involves a limited number of steps and dependencies within a single
language ecosystem and doesn't require deployment across diverse environments, a more lightweight workflow manager might be
more efficient in terms of setup and execution.

### Client - Server interaction:

Nextflow's asynchronous execution model makes it less suitable for workflows that require tight, real-time client-server
interactions between processes within the workflow itself. While Nextflow can certainly interact with external services
(like databases or web APIs), if two processes within your Nextflow workflow need to continuously communicate and depend
on each other's immediate responses, you might encounter challenges due to the inherent asynchronous nature of task execution.
In such scenarios, alternative approaches that offer more direct inter-process communication might be more appropriate.
However, if one process acts as a client to an external, independently running server, Nextflow can handle this effectively.
The key limitation lies in tightly coupled, synchronous client-server architectures *within* the Nextflow workflow.

### Learning curve:

Despite its advantages, Nextflow has a learning curve that may pose challenges for new users.
An arguable difficulty with Nextflow is the DSL is based on Groovy, an uncommon language
in Bioinformatics. The primary issue though generally seems to be less about the language, but
more the shift in thinking from linear scripts to a more declarative, dataflow-oriented approach.
For example, for loops and if statements, which are basic control structures in most scripting
languages are handled quite differently in Nextflow.

<summary>How to implement sequential processing</summary>

In linear scripts, data is usually processed by functions. The output can then be passed directly to another function or by assigning
to a variable.

```{.r filename="example.R"}
# Nested function call: We'll apply add_one to 5, and then multiply the result by 2
result <- multiply_by_two(add_one(5))
# Or sequentially
add_one_result <- add_one(5)
result <- multiply_by_two(add_one_result)

print(result) # Output: 12
```

The equivalent in Nextflow would be to use a `process`.
Although process calls can be nested, they're typically written on separate lines,
and the special `process.out` variable is used to access the process output.

```{.groovy filename="example.nf"}
workflow {
    ADD_ONE( Channel.of(5) )
    MULTIPLY_BY_TWO( ADD_ONE.out )
    MULTIPLY_BY_TWO.out.view()
}
```

For simple workflows, the alternative pipe syntax can also be used:

```{.groovy filename="example.nf"}
workflow {
    Channel.of(5)
    | ADD_ONE
    | MULTIPLY_BY_TWO
    | view
}
```

Additionally, [Channel factories](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#channel-factories) must
be used to take user input and pass it into a `process`.

<summary>How to implement the `if` control structure in Nextflow</summary>

Although one can use `if` statements in Nextflow code, often you want to decide the action
based on the output of a process. In this case, the Channel operators like `filter` and `branch`
are the solution. Here is an example of how to optionally execute a process based on the process
output.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A -->|4,5| B --> C
    A -->|1,2,3| C
```

```{.groovy filename="example.nf"}
workflow {
    TASK_A( Channel.of(1..5) )
    TASK_B( TASK_A.out.filter { num -> num.toInteger() > 3 } )
    TASK_C( TASK_A.out.filter { num -> num.toInteger() <= 3 }.mix(TASK_B.out) )
        .view()
}

process TASK_A {
    input:
    val num

    script:
    """
    echo ${num}
    """

    output:
    stdout
}

process TASK_B {
    input:
    val num

    script:
    """
    echo ${num}
    """

    output:
    stdout
}

process TASK_C {
    input:
    val num

    script:
    """
    echo ${num}
    """

    output:
    stdout
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>How to implement the `for` control structure in Nextflow</summary>

Iteration (`for`/`while` loops) is built into Nextflow. Tasks automatically
iterate over any input provided in a channel. In this example, the workflow iterates over
the numbers 1 to 5. If a channel is empty, the task does not execute.

```{.groovy filename="example.nf"}
workflow {
    TASK_A( Channel.of(1..5) )
        .view()
}

process TASK_A {
    input:
    val num

    script:
    """
    echo ${num}
    """

    output:
    stdout
}
```
