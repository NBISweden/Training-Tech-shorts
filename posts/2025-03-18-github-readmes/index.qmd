# GitHub README's

Every repository in GitHub can have an associated README. The README is often the first thing visitors see. It serves as the **front page** of your project, or your profile, and provides information to visitors and potential contributors. A well-crafted README can increase the accessibility and appeal of your project.

README's can be initialized at the creation of the repository, or added later. They are by default displayed in the code tab of the repository, underneath the files. They are encoded in **Markdown**. 

## profile README

Every personal account can have it's own README, which is displayed on top of the profile page. This is a place to share information about you and the work you are doing. 

To initialize the profile README 

- create a repository with a name that matches your GitHub user name
- make it public
- add a README

More information on the GitHub documentation pages [GitHub documentation pages](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

# Dressing up the README

Regardless of which type of README, there are some things that can be used to make the page more informative and break up the text. Most of the below options were developed for profile README's, but they can also be used on all kinds of repositories.



## üòé Add emojis

You can use emojis in the readme to clarify points (and even add them to commits, as I have just learned, use cases are to be determined). 

- ‚è± You can point out deadlines

- [üìô](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) Link to documentation

- ‚úè Or invite them to contribute

Here is a [cheat-sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

## Display top contributors:

You can  add the top contributors of your repo to the README. 

```
<a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts" alt="contrib.rocks image" />
</a>
```


<a href="https://github.com/NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts" alt="contrib.rocks image" />
</a>

## License

Make it easy for others to know what they can do with your code and add license information into your readme. Often these are placed at the top of the readme for even easier accessibility. They link to the text of the license (not in your repository, but on the web). 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Here are some [markdown license badges](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) you can use.

## Add images

You can add images to break up the text in your README. 

### Title banner

These you can use for projects, but also for your very own user readme. They are easily generated [here](https://leviarista.github.io/github-profile-header-generator/).

### Octocat

You can [design your very own octocat](https://myoctocat.com/), or [choose an existing one](https://octodex.github.com/),  and display it in your readme:

## Display skills

### Skill icons

Advertise your skills by listing [skill icons](https://github.com/tandpfun/skill-icons):

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://skillicons.dev">
    <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=git,kubernetes,docker,cpp,anaconda,bash,latex,linux,r,vscode" />
  </a>
</p>

also in light mode:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://skillicons.dev">
    <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=git,kubernetes,docker,cpp,anaconda,bash,latex,linux,r,vscode&theme=light" />
  </a>
</p>

[Here](https://github.com/LelouchFR/skill-icons) is another set of skill icons, based on the above, but with more icons, and more activity for adding new icons. 

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/">
    <img
      src="https://go-skill-icons.vercel.app/api/icons?i=git,github,apptainer,docker,nextflow,cpp,R&theme=light&titles=true"
    />
  </a>
</p>


### WidgetBox

[WidgetBox](https://github.com/Jurredr/github-widgetbox?tab=readme-ov-file) is another way to display skills. However, the boxes are rather large:

## Add Github statistics

There are several different ways to display your github stats (if you want to). By default, they will take information off your public repositories, but it is possible to gather information from the private ones too. 

The [Github Profile Summary Cards](https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/demo.html), for example, come in a lot of different [themes](https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq/github-profile-summary-cards/blob/main/README.md) and are easily incorporated:

![](http://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/api/cards/profile-details?username=amrei-bp&theme=slateorange) 

<div class='container'>
<img style="height: auto; width: 45%;" class="img" src="http://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/api/cards/repos-per-language?username=amrei-bp&theme=slateorange" />
