## 1. Goal

Show how to use GitHub Actions to:

- raise the quality of an online repository
- help maintain a coding standard
- run any Bash command

Non-goals:

- Discuss best practices
- Show and explain a more complex script/setup

## 2. What is GitHub Actions?

- A service from GitHub that is free for FOSS development
- It allows you to run code triggered by a `git` action, e.g. a `git push`

## 3.1. Problem 1

You are the only maintainer of a GitHub repository.
You want it to be of high quality.
You want to **do** instead of **talk**.
You want to show your users that you care about the quality of your project.

Every commit, however, you wonder:

- Does my new content have spelling errors?
- Are all the links pointing to a valid website?

## 3.2. Problem 2

You are one of the maintainers of a GitHub repository.
Your team members have different styles/preferences on how to write Markdown
(e.g. indent with 2 versus 4 spaces).
You and your team decided to settle on a standard.

## 3.3. Problem 3

You work on a coding project that uses a test suite to guarantee quality.
The code on the `main` `git` branch must always be a version that passes all tests.
Team members create pull requests to the `main` branch and/or
external collaborators submit code via a GitHub fork.
You do not think it is fun to check these submissions by hand.

## 3.4. Solution

- Find a GitHub Actions script from someone else
- Put it in your `.github/workflows` folder
- Commit
- Watch it in action at the 'Actions' tab

## 4.1. A general GitHub actions script

```{.bash filename="check_something.yaml"}
on: <1>
  push: <2>

jobs: <3>
  check_something: <4>
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest <5>
    steps: <6>
      # Run scripts here
```

1. Section the specify the triggers of this script
2. This script is triggered by a `git push`
3. The jobs that will be done when the script is triggered
4. The name of the job
5. The image of a virtual machine that this job uses
6. The steps of this job

## 4.2. Where to find the Actions tab

> Click on 'Actions'

## 4.3. Where to find the Actions results

## 4.4. Example 1: broken link checker

```{.bash filename="check_links.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check_links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 <1>
      - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1 <2>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine
2. Step to check all the links in the Markdown files in freshly cloned repository

## 4.5. Demonstration

<!-- This is a joke. Not a very good one, but funny enough to me :-) -->

## 4.6. Example 2: spellchecker

```{.bash filename="check_links.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check_spelling:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 <1>
      - uses: igsekor/pyspelling-any@v1.0.4 <2>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine
2. Step to check the spelling in the files in the freshly cloned repository.

## 4.7. Example 3: Markdown style checker

```{.bash filename="check_markdown_style.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check_markdown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 <1>
      - uses: articulate/actions-markdownlint@v1 <2>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine
2. Step to check the Markdown style in the files in the freshly cloned repository.

## 4.8. Example 4: Whatever you want!

```{.bash filename="run_code.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  run_code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 <1>
      - run: python --version <2>
      - run: python hello.py <3>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine
2. Check the Python version installed on the virtual machine
3. Run the Python script
