# Prefer a video?

Watch the ['RSE Tools session: GitHub Actions'](https://youtu.be/Bfd-sk0KjRc)
YouTube video.
:::

## 1.1. How would you ...?

You are the only maintainer of a FOSS ('Free and Open Source Software')
GitHub repository.

You want the repo to:

- Have no stupid spelling errors
- Have no broken hyperlinks
- Show to the users the status of the repo (e.g. it has yes/no stupid
  spelling errors at the moment)

How would you do this?

## 1.2. How would you ...?

You are one of the maintainers of a FOSS GitHub repository.
Your team members have different styles/preferences on how to write Markdown
(e.g. indent with 2 versus 4 spaces, write image captions yes/no).

You and your team want the repo to have a consistent coding standard.

How would you do this?

## 1.3. How would you ...?

You work on a FOSS coding project that uses a test suite to guarantee quality.
A user submits code using a GitHub fork and a pull request.

Before accepting the pull request, you want to make sure the submitted
code indeed passes all tests.

How would you do this?

## 2. Goals

:::{.callout-important collapse="true"}
# Understand what GitHub Actions is

A free service for FOSS development to run any code upon a `git push`
:::

:::{.callout-important collapse="true"}
# Understand why GitHub Actions are important

To guarantee quality, to collaborate better, to interact with users better
:::

:::{.callout-important collapse="true"}
# Practice to use GitHub Actions

See the exercises
:::

<!-- Shorter is better -->

Non-goals:

- Discuss best practices
- Show and explain a more complex script/setup
<!-- - Passive teaching -->
<!-- - Fill 60 minutes -->

## 3. What is GitHub Actions?

![GitHub Actions logo](gha_logo.png){width=10%}

- A Continuous Integration service from GitHub,
  that is free for FOSS development
- It allows you to run code triggered by a `git` action, e.g. a `git push`

```{.bash filename="my_gha_script.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  run_my_code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout
      - run: python hello.py
```

## 4. Why is GitHub Actions important?

- It is free (as in beer) for FOSS development
- It helps assure quality
- It helps show that you care about quality
- It helps collaboration with a team
- It helps interaction with users

## 5. How you could ...

- Find a GitHub Actions script from someone else
- Put it in your `.github/workflows` folder
- Commit
- Watch it in action at the 'Actions' tab

Alternatively, fork a repo.

## 5.1. A general GitHub Actions script

```{.bash filename="check_something.yaml"}
on: # <1>
  push: # <2>

jobs: # <3>
  check_something: # <4>
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # <5>
    steps: # <6>
      # Run scripts here
```

1. Section the specify the triggers of this script
2. This script is triggered by a `git push`
3. The jobs that will be done when the script is triggered
4. The name of the job
5. The image of a virtual machine that this job uses
6. The steps of this job

## 5.2. Example 1: broken link checker

```{.bash filename="check_links.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check_links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # <1>
      - uses: gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check@v1 # <2>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine.
   The Action can be found at
   [`https://github.com/actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
2. Step to check all the links in the Markdown files in freshly cloned
   repository.
   The Action can be found at
   [`https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check`](https://github.com/gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check)


## 5.3. Example 2: spellchecker

```{.bash filename="check_links.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check_spelling:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # <1>
      - uses: igsekor/pyspelling-any@v1.0.4 # <2>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine.
   The Action can be found at
   [`https://github.com/actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
2. Step to check the spelling in the files in the freshly cloned repository.
   The Action can be found at
   [`https://github.com/igsekor/pyspelling-any`](https://github.com/igsekor/pyspelling-any)

## 5.4. Example 3: Markdown style checker

```{.bash filename="check_markdown_style.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  check_markdown:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # <1>
      - uses: articulate/actions-markdownlint@v1 # <2>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine.
   The Action can be found at
   [`https://github.com/actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
2. Step to check the Markdown style in the files in the freshly cloned repository.
   The Action can be found at
   [`https://github.com/articulate/actions-markdownlint`](https://github.com/articulate/actions-markdownlint)

## 5.5. Example 4: Whatever you want!

```{.bash filename="run_code.yaml"}
on:
  push:

jobs:
  run_code:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # <1>
      - run: python --version # <2>
      - run: python hello.py # <3>
```

1. Step to clone the GitHub repository to the local virtual machine
2. Check the Python version installed on the virtual machine
3. Run the Python script

## 7. FAQ

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# What are those `@v`s in the GHA scripts?

These are version numbers.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How will I know which version to use?

You use the version that works, until it breaks.
Then you update it.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How long may my scripts run?

Two hours.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I do different things in parallel a GHA script?

Yes.

In technical terms, this means that your GHA script has multiple jobs.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I combine multiple GHA scripts into one?

Yes.

In technical terms, this means that your GHA script has multiple jobs,
that will run in parallel.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Why don't you combine the multiple GHA scripts into one?

Because I enjoy any piece of code doing one single thing well
and, due to that, can have a descriptive name.

You preferences may differ, which is fine :-)
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can it be made to run on Windows machines too?

Yes, it can be made to run on *virtual* Windows machines.

No, it does not run on Windows hardware: for that, use AppVeyor instead.
An example is
[this AppVeyor script to generate the Windows executable of a computer game](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/conquer_chess/blob/main/.appveyor.yml).
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can it be made to run on MacOS machines too?

Yes, it can be made to run on *virtual* MacOS machines.

No, it does not run on MacOS hardware: for that, use CircleCI instead.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Does GitLab/Codeberg/CircleCI have this?

Yes.

You will need to provide a 'runner', i.e. a service that
will run your scripts upon a `git push`.
As far as I know, these are not free.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can GitHub Actions work with a schedule?

Yes. 

An example is
[the SCoRe user documentation script `update_content.yaml`](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/update_content.yaml)
where a website is updated daily
:::


:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can GitHub Actions trigger only on certain file changes?

Yes. 

An example is
[the SCoRe user documentation script `check_markdown.yaml`](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/check_markdown.yaml)
which is triggered when a Markdown file is changed,
or when a configuration file about this is changed.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Do I have `sudo` rights?

Yes.

This allows you to install anything you like.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I use GitHub Actions to create a commit?

Yes.

In [this GitHub Actions script](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/create_website.yaml)
an HTML website is created from Markdown, where the plain HTML is
pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.

This may be a bit more tricky. In this case:

- The GHA bot needs permissions to push
- GitHub Pages need to be active

Both can be set in the Settings of the repo.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I use GitHub Actions to create an infinite chain of commits?

I assume yes: if one GHA script creates a commit, that triggers
another script that creates a commit, which triggers
another script that creates a commit, etc., then I assume yes.

However, I have never tested this. Let me know what you find :-)
:::


:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I use GitHub Actions to create a file (e.g. the result of a long calculation)?

Yes.

In [this GitHub Actions script](https://github.com/uppsala-makerspace/vevor_vinyl_cutter_to_t_shirt_manual/blob/main/.github/workflows/create_pdfs.yaml#L77)
some PDFs are created, which are then uploaded.

These can then be downloaded as artifacts.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I use GitHub Actions to deploy my website?

Yes.

- SCoRe user documentation' MkDocs website uses
  [this GitHub Actions script](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc/blob/main/.github/workflows/create_website.yaml)
- RSE Tools Quarto websit uses
  [this GitHub Actions script](https://github.com/NBISweden/Training-Tech-shorts/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml)

Deploying a website can be a bit more tricky:

- The GHA bot may need permissions to push
- GitHub Pages may need to be active and setup correctly

Thes settings can be set in the 'Settings' tab of the repo.
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Can I disable a GitHub Action?

Yes.

![In the 'Actions' menu, click the kebab button at the right, then 'Disable workflow'](gha_disable_workflow.png)
:::

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How can I get a badge?

![In the 'Actions' menu, click the kebab button at the right, then 'Create status badge'](gha_create_status_badge.png)

This will provide you with the Markdown code you can copy-paste to,
for example, `README.md`.

An example is [the SCoRe user documentation](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc?tab=readme-ov-file#score-user-documentation):

## 8. Findings in the literature

A continuous integration service (such as GitHub Actions):

- Bugs are exposed around 20 times faster `[Vasilescu et al., 2015]`

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How did you calculate that number?

From `[Vasilescu et al., 2015]` table 6:

- 0.4 bugs per month are found by by core developers
- 0.164 bugs per month are found by by external collaborators
- Hence 0.564 bugs per month are found
- Per month, projects report 0.026 bug less

This means that 0.564 found by CI per 0.026 'solved' by time,
`0.564 / 0.026 = 21.692307692`
:::

- New features are added around 4 times faster `[Vasilescu et al., 2015]`

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How did you calculate that number?

From `[Vasilescu et al., 2015]` table 4:

- 0.049 (intercept) PRs per month are merged by core developers when there is no CI
- 0.049 (intercept) + 0.187 (slope) = 0.236 per month are merged by core developers when there is CI

This means that (N-O)/O = (0.236 - 0.049) / 0.049 = 3.8 times more PRs merged
when CI is on.
:::

You can use GitHub Actions to run your test suite(s).

- Coding errors are extremely common `[Baggerly and Coombes, 2009]`

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How common?

In all of the papers used to illustrate errors in published
bioinformatics analyses.
Each of these papers had simple errors, such as using the
incorrect number of samples (this matters when taking an average :-) ).
:::


- Simple testing can prevent most critical failures `[Yuan et al., 2014]`

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How much?

A 100 percent (!) of the catastrophic failures (i.e. the most problematic
type of failures)
would be exposed by using code coverage testing to find
the error handling logic, after which that logic is tested
by a simple unit test.

A simple example they show is a developer leaving a `TODO` in
the error handling code.
:::

You can use GitHub Actions to measure code coverage, which is
the percentage of code tested.

- Code coverage correlates, sometimes very strongly, with code quality
  `[Horgan et al., 1994][Del Frate et al., 1995]`

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How much?

Going from 62% to 92% code coverage means that 227% more faults are detected.

From `[Horgan et al., 1994]` Table 2:

- 1 test, 62% block coverage, 30.2% faults detected
- 21000 test, 91.8% block coverage, 98.9% faults detected

The change: `(N - O) / O = (98.9 - 30.2) / 30.2 = 2.274834437 = 227%

From `[Del Frate et al., 1995]` Figure 2 we can see the ranges
in correlation coefficients in different programs:

- Ranges: [0.16 - 0.91], [-0.10 - 0.72],
  [0.93 - 0.99], [0.89 - 0.91], and [0.98 - 0.99]
- Middle of these ranges: 0.535, 0.31, 0.96, 0.90, 0.985
- Average of these: (0.535 + 0.31 + 0.96 + 0.90 + 0.985) / 5 = 74%

:::

- Some communities make 100% code coverage mandatory to pass a code peer-review
  (e.g. rOpenSci `[Hart et al., 2013]`)

You can use GitHub Actions to check for coding style,
such as Python's PEP8 `[PEP 8]` and R's Tidyverse `[Wickham, 2019]` style.

## 9. Exercises

## 9.1. Exercise 1: work with GitHub Actions

- Fork [`https://github.com/NBISweden/rse_tools_github_actions_example_20260122.git`](https://github.com/NBISweden/rse_tools_github_actions_example_20260122.git)

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# Is forking this repo identical to copy-pasting a fresh repo from scratch?

Yes.

There is no hidden state in the forked GitHub repo:  
Copy-pasting the scripts to a repo made from scratch works
exactly the same.
:::

- Read the section ['How to view an error log'](#how-to-view-an-error-log)
- Find the error messages and fix all the errors

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
# How do I fix the false positives spelling errors?

Indeed, there are some words pointed out as spelling errors, when they are not.
In this repo, `Pelle Svanslös` is a valid name of a fictional character. 

Some repositories, such as
[the SCoRe user documentation](https://github.com/NBISweden/SCoRe_user_doc?tab=readme-ov-file#files-used-by-continuous-integration-scripts)
document which files belong to which CI scripts.

From that, one can deduce that `.wordlist.txt` needs to have the following
two lines added:

```{.text filename=".wordlist.txt"}
Pelle
Svanslös
```

:::

## 9.2. Exercise 2: find GitHub Actions

- Surf to [the GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
- Find something you would like a GitHub Action to do
- If you found something, try to make it work by copy-pasting
  an example script from the documentation of your favorite Action.

## 9.3. Exercise 3: literature

- Read the section ['Findings in the literature'](#findings-in-the-literature).
  Do you think using GitHub Actions is worth it?

:::{.callout-note}
You are always welcome to discuss the finding in the academic literature
on this with me!
