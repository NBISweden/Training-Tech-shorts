Here are some 5-minute tips and tricks we covered in todays training.

## Setting the terminal prompt using Liquid Prompt

You can customize your terminal prompt by modifying the `PS1` variable in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) using a tool called [Liquid Prompt](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html). This tool dynamically updates the prompt to provide useful status information, such as your username, active Conda environment, current path, and Git branch status.

To use Liquid Prompt, clone the Liquid Prompt repository in your home directory (or another location), then source it in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, and select the theme for a visually appealing prompt.

Here there is an example of the lines to include in your `.zshrc` file to set the powerline theme, assuming you have cloned the Liquid prompt repository to your home directory:

```{.bash}
if [[ $- == *i* ]]; then
    # Only load Liquidprompt in interactive shells
    source ~/liquidprompt/liquidprompt
    source ~/liquidprompt/themes/powerline/powerline.theme
    lp_theme powerline
fi
```

Some terminal fonts may not be compatible with a theme. If the prompt looks misaligned or includes strange characters, try switching to a compatible font in the terminal settings.

## Edit Quarto Markdown tables in VSCode visual mode

The VSCode Quarto extension allows you to edit quarto files in visual mode, which is quite useful when working with tables. Visual mode provides a better interface for creating and editing tables without manually writing the table in markdown syntax. 

One can easily switch between Source and Visual mode of quarto edition using VS code keyboard shortcuts. 

## Adding captions to Quarto figures and tables

Here are three methods to add captions to figures and tables in Quarto.

## The Here package in R

The `here` package in R helps you set paths.

## Managing R packages using PacMan

PacMan is a R package manager.

## The Nano editor

Nano is an editor you can use in the Terminal.

It's loaded on Dardel using `ml nano`.

## Setting group permissions on Dardel

Dardel doesn't automatically set group permissions on files. You can update them using

```{.bash}
    # change permissions so all members of the project can access the files
    # thanks to Karl Johan from PDC support for this useful tidbit!
    # change the file ownership to group:
    chgrp --no-dereference --silent --recursive ${GRP} ${PWD}
    # change permission: group gets user's permissions
    chmod --silent --recursive g=u ${PWD}
```

This can be added to launch scripts like [this `run_nextflow.sh` example](https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/nf-core_on_dardel/blob/main/runscript.sh).

## MacOS shortcuts

- Use the `ditto` command to copy directories while preserving permissions and timestamps.
- Use `history 15` to view your last 15 commands.
- The `banner` command prints large text banners in the terminal.
- Drag and drop files or folders into the terminal to paste their paths.
- Use `Option+Click` to move the cursor anywhere in the command line.
- In Finder, `Cmd+I` opens the info panel, where you can copy file paths or customize folder icons.

## Step through code from a Pixi environment in Quarto

R packages can easily be installed in pixi environments to help resolve version incompatibilities or to ensure that others working in your project can replicate your environment.

```{.bash}
pixi init -c bioconda -c conda-forge -p linux-64
pixi add r-base
pixi add r-tidyverse
pixi add bioconductor-phyloseq
pixi install
```

You can then knit your Quarto report by first activating your pixi environment containing your R installation. However, if you want to be able to view objects in your session in vs code (requires the R extension) and execute code line by line when writing your Quarto report, you can do so by including the following line in your report:

```{.r}
.libPaths("/path/to/pixi/directory/.pixi/envs/default/lib/R/library")
```

This prevents the need for activating your pixi environment before knitting the report and enables interactive coding in your Quarto report.

## Using a Conda lock file in Nextflow

Managing package drift is a key challenge for reproducibility when using Conda. Typically, users create environments from an `environment.yml` file, sometimes pinning specific package versions. However, indirect dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) are not always pinned, which means your environment may become unresolvable or behave differently over time as upstream packages change.

To address this, it's best practice to generate a Conda lock file, which captures the exact versions of all packages (including dependencies) in your environment. This ensures that others can recreate the environment exactly as you had it, even months later. You can generate a lock file using the `--explicit` flag with `conda list`:

```{.bash}
# In an activated environment
conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt
```
Alternatively, you can use:

```{.bash}
conda env export --name <env> --explicit > spec-file.txt
```

To recreate the environment from this lock file, use:

```{.bash}
conda create --name <env> --file spec-file.txt
```

While this approach is helpful for reproducibility, it can become unwieldy if you need to manage many environments. Fortunately, Nextflow supports using Conda lock files (which must have a `.txt` extension). Simply reference your lock file in the `conda` directive within your process definition, and enable Conda in your Nextflow configuration:

```{.groovy filename="my_process.nf"}
process MY_PROCESS {
  conda "${moduleDir}/spec-file.txt"

  input:
  ...
}
```

```{.groovy filename="nextflow.config"}
conda.enabled = true
```

Place `spec-file.txt` in the same directory as your process script.

When building pipelines with nf-core modules, you'll find that they often come with prebuilt containers and Conda environment files, but not with lock files. You can use [Seqera Containers](https://seqera.io/containers/) to build or pull a prebuilt container and extract its lock file.

For example, MultiQC has a [prebuilt container](https://wave.seqera.io/view/builds/bd-e3ef3b42c5f9f0da_1). The build log shows that an `environment.lock` file is included inside the container. To extract this lock file, run:

To extract the lock file from the container we can use:

```{.bash}
docker run --rm -it community.wave.seqera.io/library/multiqc:1.29--e3ef3b42c5f9f0da cat environment.lock > multiqc-1.29-spec-file.txt
```

You can now use this lock file with the `conda` directive in Nextflow to recreate the same environment as the Docker container.
