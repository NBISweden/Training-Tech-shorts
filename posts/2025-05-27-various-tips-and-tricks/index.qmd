Here are some 5min Tips and Tricks we covered in todays training.

## Setting the terminal prompt using Liquid Screen

You can customize your terminal prompt by modifying the `PS1` variable in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) using a tool called [Liquid Screen](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).

```{.bash}
if [[ $- == *i* ]]; then
    # Only load Liquidprompt in interactive shells
    source ~/liquidprompt/liquidprompt
    source ~/liquidprompt/themes/powerline/powerline.theme
    lp_theme powerline
fi
```

## Edit Quarto Markdown tables in VSCode visual mode

The VSCode Quarto extension allows you to edit markdown visually.

## Adding captions to Quarto figures and tables

Here are three methods to add captions to figures and tables in Quarto.

## The Here package in R

The `here` package in R helps you set paths.

## Managing R packages using PacMan

PacMan is a R package manager.

## The Nano editor

Nano is an editor you can use in the Terminal.

It's loaded on Dardel using `ml nano`.

## Setting group permissions on Dardel

Dardel doesn't automatically set group permissions on files. You can update them using

```{.bash}
    # change permissions so all members of the project can access the files
    # thanks to Karl Johan from PDC support for this useful tidbit!
    # change the file ownership to group:
    chgrp --no-dereference --silent --recursive ${GRP} ${PWD}
    # change permission: group gets user's permissions
    chmod --silent --recursive g=u ${PWD}
```

This can be added to launch scripts like [this `run_nextflow.sh` example](https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/nf-core_on_dardel/blob/main/runscript.sh).

## MacOS shortcuts

## Step through code from a Pixi environment in Quarto

## Using a Conda lock file in Nextflow
