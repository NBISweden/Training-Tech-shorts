Here are some 5-minute tips and tricks we covered in todays training.

## Setting the terminal prompt using Liquid Prompt

You can customize your terminal prompt by modifying the `PS1` variable in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) using a tool called [Liquid Prompt](https://liquidprompt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html). This tool dynamically updates the prompt to provide useful status information, such as your username, active Conda environment, current path, and Git branch status.

To use Liquid Prompt, clone the Liquid Prompt repository in your home directory (or another location), then source it in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`, and select the theme for a visually appealing prompt.

Here there is an example of the lines to include in your `.zshrc` file to set the powerline theme, assuming you have cloned the Liquid prompt repository to your home directory:

```{.bash}
if [[ $- == *i* ]]; then
    # Only load Liquidprompt in interactive shells
    source ~/liquidprompt/liquidprompt
    source ~/liquidprompt/themes/powerline/powerline.theme
    lp_theme powerline
fi
```

Some terminal fonts may not be compatible with a theme. If the prompt looks misaligned or includes strange characters, try switching to a compatible font in the terminal settings.

## Edit Quarto Markdown tables in VSCode visual mode

The VSCode Quarto extension allows you to edit quarto files in visual mode, which is quite useful when working with tables. Visual mode provides a better interface for creating and editing tables without manually writing the table in markdown syntax. 

One can easily switch between Source and Visual mode of quarto edition using VS code keyboard shortcuts. 

## Adding captions to Quarto figures and tables

Here are three methods to add captions to figures and tables in Quarto.

## The Here package in R

The `here` package in R helps you set paths.

## Managing R packages using PacMan

PacMan is a R package manager.

## The Nano editor

Nano is an editor you can use in the Terminal.

It's loaded on Dardel using `ml nano`.

## Setting group permissions on Dardel

Dardel doesn't automatically set group permissions on files. You can update them using

```{.bash}
    # change permissions so all members of the project can access the files
    # thanks to Karl Johan from PDC support for this useful tidbit!
    # change the file ownership to group:
    chgrp --no-dereference --silent --recursive ${GRP} ${PWD}
    # change permission: group gets user's permissions
    chmod --silent --recursive g=u ${PWD}
```

This can be added to launch scripts like [this `run_nextflow.sh` example](https://github.com/SLUBioinformaticsInfrastructure/nf-core_on_dardel/blob/main/runscript.sh).

## MacOS shortcuts

- Use the `ditto` command to copy directories while preserving permissions and timestamps.
- Use `history 15` to view your last 15 commands.
- The `banner` command prints large text banners in the terminal.
- Drag and drop files or folders into the terminal to paste their paths.
- Use `Option+Click` to move the cursor anywhere in the command line.
- In Finder, `Cmd+I` opens the info panel, where you can copy file paths or customize folder icons.
