## How to login to Gitpod

- Go to the [Gitpod site](https://gitpod.io)

- Select your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub), and authenticate

- If successful you should land on the workspaces page, with organisation settings at top left, and personal settings at top right

- Now when you start a Gitpod environment you'll be connected to your version control system

## How to start a Gitpod 

To start a workspace, follow these steps:

- Navigate to your repository on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. 
- Add `gitpod.io/#` before the URL address of your repository. This will create a new URL address that directs you to the Gitpod workspace setup page. On that page, you can make the following choices:
    1. The source repository for which the gitpod workspace will be created.
    2. The code editor. 
    3. The computing resources required for the workspace. 
- After making your choices, the code editor will open, allowing the user can start working on the files in the repository. The user's working directory is a cloned folder of the Github repository located on the Gitpod server, not lcoally on the computer. 
- Any changes to the files within that folder can be pushed to the repository using Git commands. 

**Note**: If you are editing a public Github public repository, Gitpod requires the "public_repo" permission to push changes. To do it, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to gitpod.io.
2. Click on your user icon
3. Click "user settings"
4. Navigate to "Git Providers"
5. Click the actions icon on the GitHub provider
6. Click "edit permissions"
7. Check "public_repo"
8. Click "Update permissions"
9. You will be redirected to Github for authentication.

After granting permissions, the user can push changes to the repository.
