## Uses for Gitpod (Jason / Estelle to review)

- Demonstration: The containerized nature of gitpod makes it useful for serving instances of a program in a standardized environment for demonstration.

- Development: There are many software development tools available in the standard docker container. Pull requests can be managed from within gitpod and explored safely within a container.

- Experimentation: The ephemeral nature of the environment, and its standardizeed tools make gitpod excellent for testing code and sandbox experimentation.

- Training: A pre-built environment can be provided which can be very useful if, for example, Rackham is down during a course.
