# Gitpod

## What is Gitpod

Gitpod is a developer environment that runs in your browser. In order to use it, you need a Git repository (either on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket). Gitpod opens up a container on your Git repository. This container is built from the file ".gitpod.yml" present in the repository.   

There are different pricing depending on your needs such as:  

- Free plan (50 hours per month)

- Pas-as-you-go  

- Company plan (custom)

NBIS does not have a Gitpod account. Mahesh has an open source plan (nammed NBIS).


## How to login to Gitpod

- Go to the [Gitpod site](https://gitpod.io)

- Select your Git hosting service (e.g., GitHub), and authenticate

- If successful you should land on the workspaces page, with organisation settings at top left, and personal settings at top right

- Now when you start a Gitpod environment you'll be connected to your version control system

## Uses for Gitpod (Jason / Estelle to review)

- Demonstration: The containerized nature of gitpod makes it useful for serving instances of a program in a standardized environment for demonstration.

- Development: There are many software development tools available in the standard docker container. Pull requests can be managed from within gitpod and explored safely within a container.

- Experimentation: The ephemeral nature of the environment, and its standardizeed tools make gitpod excellent for testing code and sandbox experimentation.

- Training: A pre-built environment can be provided which can be very useful if, for example, Rackham is down during a course.
